I just finished building a project where developers and businesses can use it to understand the contents of an image. It can perform general purpose detection/classification, detect four coordinates of each bounding box and identify most dominant colours in hex format.

Example : ``` curl -u demo:tango -F "file=@/Users/abc/Desktop/1.png" https://d9c19fe8.ngrok.io ```
